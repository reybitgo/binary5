# Dashboard Refactoring - URL-based Navigation

This refactoring changes the dashboard from hash-based navigation to URL parameter-based routing with separate page files.

## New File Structure

```
project/
├── dashboard.php           # Main dashboard file (router)
├── pages/                  # Individual page content
│   ├── overview.php       # Dashboard overview
│   ├── binary.php         # Binary tree view
│   ├── referrals.php      # Referrals management
│   ├── leadership.php     # Leadership bonuses
│   ├── mentor.php         # Mentor bonuses
│   ├── wallet.php         # Wallet operations
│   ├── store.php          # Package store
│   └── settings.php       # User settings
├── js/
│   └── chart-functions.js # Shared D3.js chart functions
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Dashboard (`dashboard.php`)

- Removed hash-based JavaScript navigation
- Added URL parameter routing (`?page=section`)
- Moved form handling to main file for centralized processing
- Added active state highlighting for sidebar navigation
- Simplified JavaScript to only handle mobile sidebar and chart initialization

### 2. Individual Page Files (`pages/*.php`)

- Each section is now a separate PHP file
- Files contain only the HTML content for their respective sections
- Form actions point back to main dashboard with proper redirects
- Chart initialization moved to individual page files where needed

### 3. Shared Chart Functions (`js/chart-functions.js`)

- Extracted D3.js chart rendering logic to shared file
- Eliminates code duplication between binary and leadership pages
- Maintains all original chart functionality (zoom, expand/collapse, etc.)

### 4. Navigation Changes

- Sidebar links now use standard HTTP links: `dashboard.php?page=section`
- Active page highlighting based on URL parameter
- Mobile sidebar behavior preserved
- Form submissions redirect to appropriate pages with flash messages

## Benefits

1. **SEO Friendly**: Real URLs instead of hash fragments
2. **Browser History**: Back/forward buttons work properly
3. **Bookmarkable**: Users can bookmark specific sections
4. **Maintainable**: Each section in its own file for easier maintenance
5. **Server-side Routing**: Better control over page access and permissions
6. **Code Organization**: Cleaner separation of concerns

## Usage

Navigate to different sections using:

- `dashboard.php` or `dashboard.php?page=overview` - Overview
- `dashboard.php?page=binary` - Binary Tree
- `dashboard.php?page=referrals` - Referrals
- `dashboard.php?page=leadership` - Leadership
- `dashboard.php?page=mentor` - Mentor Bonus
- `dashboard.php?page=wallet` - Wallet
- `dashboard.php?page=store` - Package Store
- `dashboard.php?page=settings` - Settings

## Implementation Notes

- All form actions redirect back to `dashboard.php` with appropriate page parameter
- Flash messages are preserved across redirects
- Chart initialization happens automatically when visiting binary or leadership pages
- Mobile sidebar functionality remains unchanged
- All original features and functionality are preserved
