## üßÆ Calculation Example

Let‚Äôs see how the bonuses actually flow with numbers:

### Scenario

- Alice (User A) has Bob (downline, Level 1).
- Bob earns **100 USDT in Pairing Bonus** from his own downlines.
- Alice also has an upline, Carol.

### Step 1: Pairing Bonus

- Bob receives his **100 USDT** Pairing Bonus.

### Step 2: Matched Bonus (Alice earns from Bob)

- Alice qualifies for **Matched Bonus Level 1** (PVT 100 USDT, GVT 500 USDT).
- Alice earns **5% of Bob‚Äôs 100 USDT** = **5 USDT**.

### Step 3: Mentor Bonus (Bob earns from Carol)

- Carol (upline above Alice) qualifies for **Mentor Bonus Level 1**.
- Carol earns **3% of Alice‚Äôs Binary Earnings**.
- Since Alice just earned 5 USDT from Matched Bonus, Carol earns: **3% of 5 USDT = 0.15 USDT**.

### Step 4: Wallet Reflection

- Bob‚Äôs wallet: **+100 USDT**
- Alice‚Äôs wallet: **+5 USDT**
- Carol‚Äôs wallet: **+0.15 USDT**

All balances stored in **USDT**, but actual withdrawals happen via **B2P** token.
